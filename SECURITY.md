# GLIN Wallet - Security Audit Documentation

## Security Overview

GLIN Wallet is an open-source browser extension wallet for the GLIN AI Training Network. This document outlines the security measures, potential risks, and audit guidelines.

## Security Architecture

### Key Management

#### Seed Phrase Storage
- **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM encryption via TweetNaCl
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations
- **Salt**: Unique per wallet, 32 bytes
- **Nonce**: Unique per encryption operation, 24 bytes
- **Storage**: IndexedDB with encrypted values only

#### Password Requirements
- Minimum 8 characters
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one number
- No password strength meter (intentional simplicity)

#### Private Keys
- Never stored in plaintext
- Derived on-demand from encrypted seed
- Cleared from memory after use
- Not logged or transmitted

### Data Protection

#### Sensitive Data Handling
✅ **Protected**:
- Seed phrases (encrypted at rest)
- Private keys (ephemeral, derived on-demand)
- Passwords (hashed for verification)
- Transaction signing (in-memory only)

❌ **Never Stored**:
- Plaintext passwords
- Unencrypted private keys
- Sensitive data in localStorage
- API keys or secrets

#### Storage Security
- **IndexedDB**: Encrypted wallet data only
- **chrome.storage.local**: Non-sensitive preferences (theme, network)
- **chrome.storage.sync**: NOT USED (security risk)

### Communication Security

#### Message Passing
- Chrome extension message passing API
- Content script isolation
- Background script validation
- Message type verification
- Timeout handling (30s default)

#### Network Security
- WebSocket connections (wss://) only
- RPC endpoint validation
- No HTTP fallbacks
- Certificate pinning (browser handles)

#### Dapp Integration
- Origin verification
- User approval required for:
  - Connection requests
  - Message signing
  - Transaction signing
- Permission model per dapp
- Easy disconnection

## Threat Model

### High-Risk Threats

1. **Seed Phrase Extraction**
   - **Risk**: Malicious code extracting encrypted seed
   - **Mitigation**:
     - Code review before release
     - Encryption at rest
     - No network transmission
     - Open source for community audit

2. **XSS Attacks**
   - **Risk**: Injected scripts accessing wallet
   - **Mitigation**:
     - CSP headers in manifest
     - Input sanitization
     - React's built-in XSS protection
     - No dangerouslySetInnerHTML usage

3. **Phishing**
   - **Risk**: Fake dapp connection requests
   - **Mitigation**:
     - Clear origin display
     - User confirmation required
     - Connected sites management
     - Warning messages

4. **Man-in-the-Middle**
   - **Risk**: RPC connection interception
   - **Mitigation**:
     - WSS (TLS) connections only
     - Browser certificate validation
     - No custom certificate handling

### Medium-Risk Threats

5. **Brute Force Attacks**
   - **Risk**: Password guessing
   - **Mitigation**:
     - Strong password requirements
     - Rate limiting (planned)
     - Account lockout (planned)

6. **Supply Chain Attacks**
   - **Risk**: Malicious dependencies
   - **Mitigation**:
     - Minimal dependencies
     - Regular security audits
     - Package lock files
     - Dependabot alerts

7. **Extension Compromise**
   - **Risk**: Malicious extension update
   - **Mitigation**:
     - Code signing (Chrome Web Store)
     - Open source transparency
     - Community review
     - Version pinning

### Low-Risk Threats

8. **Memory Dumps**
   - **Risk**: Sensitive data in RAM
   - **Mitigation**:
     - Ephemeral key derivation
     - Memory clearing (where possible)
     - Auto-lock timer

9. **Clipboard Attacks**
   - **Risk**: Clipboard monitoring
   - **Mitigation**:
     - User awareness warnings
     - Temporary clipboard exposure
     - Visual confirmations

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

✅ **Do**:
- Keep your recovery phrase offline and secure
- Use a strong, unique password
- Verify connection requests before approving
- Keep the extension updated
- Use hardware wallets for large amounts (when supported)

❌ **Don't**:
- Share your recovery phrase with anyone
- Reuse passwords across services
- Click suspicious connection requests
- Install from untrusted sources

### For Developers

✅ **Do**:
- Review all code changes for security
- Run security linters (ESLint security rules)
- Test with malicious inputs
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Use TypeScript for type safety

❌ **Don't**:
- Log sensitive data
- Store secrets in code
- Use eval() or dangerous functions
- Trust user input without validation

## Known Limitations

1. **No Hardware Wallet Support** (yet)
   - Planned for future releases
   - Currently software-only key storage

2. **No Multi-Signature** (yet)
   - Single signature transactions only
   - Multi-sig planned for v2

3. **No Biometric Unlock**
   - Password-only authentication
   - WebAuthn integration planned

4. **Limited Rate Limiting**
   - No request throttling (yet)
   - Planned for backend integration
